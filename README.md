Now we can start filling in the data on the sheet.

### Upper part
![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/8e4bae0b-9db9-485a-90aa-c5e7ceb4fc7c)

At the top right we have where to write down the evolution points. Then we have where to write down the character's Concept and Lineage.

Just below is the Milestone marker, where we can mark the boxes as we achieve milestones. We can also make a roll to see if we can activate our Lineage Power by clicking on the Milestone field. We will roll as many dice as the boxes 1d, 2d, 3d, 4d, 5d are checked.

Finally we have the field to describe the Lineage Power to which the PC belongs.

### Abilities Tab
![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/16a79e3e-221c-4b57-95df-6c38d78f41a1)

In this tab we have the general and combat abilities, the list of languages and equipment, the combat skills we have, the Vitality and Incapacitation markers, the weapons and protection, a field to put the PC's Coat of Arms and the selector for the Initiative.

#### Abilities
The five general abilities are marked in grey. The value of each can be modified in the white circle and rolls can be made by clicking on the name of the ability (with bonus or penalty by pressing the Shift key). We also have the spaces to add the Specialities below each one.

The two Combat Abilities work the same, but they do not have specialities, instead you can add Skills to them. To do this you only need to have created an item with the Skill template and drag it to the character's sheet (see below for more information on how to create skills).

#### Languages
Clicking on the + icon adds a field where we can write one of the languages spoken by the PJ, we can add as many as we want by clicking on the + icon.

#### Equipment
Clicking on the + icon adds a field where we can write the equipment item the PJ is wearing, we can add as many as we want by clicking on the + icon.

#### Coat of Arms
If we pass the mouse over the coat of arms we will see how the edit icon appears, to change it we only have to click on the image in the dialogue that will appear, click on the image icon above and change the path to the path where we have the image of the coat of arms we want to put.

#### Vitality and Incapacitation Markers
On these markers we can mark the damage we are taking.

In the case of Vitality, marking boxes will limit the number of dice we can roll for abilities and magic (this is already implemented). The maximum dice we can roll will be the value of the highest unchecked square.

In the case of Incapacitation there are two boxes in grey because with some improvements (that will appear in the basic book) you can increase the incapacitation that a PC is able to withstand.

#### Weapons
![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/c59e5cc8-bcc4-4679-8ed7-73f3e4735b60)

To add weapons to your character, just drag the weapons you have created as items with the Weapon Template to your character's sheet (see below for more information on how to create them).

Clicking on the name will allow you to edit their fields and clicking on the Base Damage will produce the weapon's damage roll.

#### Protection
![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/abd41840-ec4b-4d9f-86dc-7a836a9cb2a7)

In the top row we can add the armour we are wearing, select what type it is, if a certain level of Vigour is required to wear it, how many dice of damage it reduces and if it has any resistance value. In case it has resistance, next to it will appear the boxes to mark the incapacitation it can withstand.

In the bottom row we can add the shield if they have one. In the armour type you can only select Shield and it does not have a Resistance field.

#### Initiative Selector
![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/e54744cc-3c3b-4d3f-9764-472a3466bf98)

Just below the protection we have a selector that will determine the Initiative value we are going to have. It depends mainly on the type of weapon we are going to use or the action we are going to do and is calculated automatically.

### Magic Tab
![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/03f4293d-360b-4ec8-856e-90218502a55f)

In this tab you will find everything related to magic.

#### Magic and Magic Mastery
In these two tabs you can select what kind of Magic you use and what kind of mastery you have. In case the Mastery is Practitioner, the maximum Magnitude 3 limitation will be applied automatically to the magic rolls.

#### Magic Actions and Targets
In the Magic Actions section you can assign a value to each action by typing the number in the white circle.

In the Targets section you can add as many targets as you need by clicking on the + icon, enter the name of the target and the value and make the rolls by clicking on the dice icon.

When you make a roll by clicking on the dice icon for the chosen Target you will be presented with a dialogue where you can select which Magic Action to use. You will roll as many dice as the sum of Magic Action and Target.

![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/83100e29-bf1b-4ba2-9590-e13c199977a9)

#### Fatigue
On this marker you can cross off boxes as you receive magic fatigue (one for every 5 or 6 you roll on magic rolls if you are a Practitioner, one for every 6 if you are a Scholar or for other actions you take as described in the Getting Started Guide).

#### Magic Magnitudes
This table is only informative of the Magnitudes needed depending on the circumstances.

#### Personal Grimoire
In this section you can add custom spells by clicking on the + icon.

You can give the spell a name and you will have to select an Action and a Target from the dropdowns, which will determine the value of the roll. In the description you can describe the effect the spell has. Clicking on Roll rolls the dice for the spell.

### Background and Notes tab
![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/076f82dd-ef79-4086-bb49-0dde8386d7ec)

In this tab you can add your character's description, background and any notes you want.

## Create an NPC
Create a new actor, select the template "NPC_WK_Template" and click the refresh button next to the Template selection.

![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/52d4dde2-a24d-4d85-be71-ff36992bc5e2)

Now we can start to fill in the data in the tab.

### Top part
![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/34a55f43-1568-4f80-b409-1c22be8d7d0b)

At the top we have where to write the Character Concept.

Just below is the Vitality Multiplier. Selecting a value will show the corresponding Vitality boxes.

Below this we have the Massive value and the Incapacitation value. The number we put in incapacitation will be the number of boxes it will have. In general it should be a specific one according to the vitality (if you have a vitality multiplier x1,5 the incapacitation should be 6 squares (4 is normal)), but I have put them independently to give more flexibility.

### Weapons
![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/e2bc7e21-f919-4c6b-9347-538119f35e7c)

To add weapons to your NPC just drag the weapons you have created as items with the Weapon Template to the NPC tab (see below for how to create them).

If we click on the name we can edit their fields and if we click on the Base Damage it will produce the damage roll for the weapon.

### Protection
![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/25f8dfb9-1a61-433d-a59f-1510f168ca93)

In the top row we can add the armour we are wearing, select what type it is, if a certain level of Vigour is required to wear it, how many damage dice it reduces and if it has any resistance value. In case it has resistance, next to it will appear the boxes to mark the incapacitation it can withstand.

In the bottom row we can add the shield if it has one. In the armour type you can only select Shield and it doesn't have the Resistance field.

### Initiative Selector
![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/d1b4f5ee-a72e-4053-8699-f7ca4448befa)

Just below the protection we have a selector that will determine the Initiative value we are going to have. It depends mainly on the type of weapon we are going to use or the action we are going to do and is calculated automatically.

### Vitality and Incapacitation Markers
![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/800276a0-746a-4f9d-b3c7-984a2477e5bb)

On these markers we can mark the damage the NPC is taking. Depending on the Vitality Multiplier and the Incapacitation value, the number of squares will be different.

In the case of Vitality, marking boxes will limit the number of dice we can roll for abilities and magic (this is already implemented). The maximum dice we can roll will be the value of the highest unchecked square.

### Description
In this section you can describe the NPC or write down any special rules he may have.

## Create Weapons

In Category you can add which category it belongs to (edged, blunt, projectile, etc). In hands it takes you can put how many hands are needed to use that weapon. In Base Damage you can add the number of dice it does damage (numerical value). In Reach you can add how far the weapon can reach and in notes you can add information such as if it produces Trauma or any other special ability it may have.

To add it to an NPC or PC you must drag the weapon from the menu on the right to the corresponding NPC or PC.

If there are any unsuccessful dice in the roll, a button will appear in the chat message asking if you have a Specialty. If you click it, the unsuccessful dice will be rolled and the successes will be added together.

![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/884c0a46-9cc8-46be-b855-67d51321222f) ![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/the-winter-king-csb/assets/148097688/92dd996d-1808-41cc-9c22-09cf0b75a462)
